<b>QUESTION 1</b> <br>
The Stanton measure of an array is computed as follows. Count the number of 1s in the array. Let this count be n. The Stanton measure is the number of times that n appears in the array. For example, the Stanton measure of {1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2} is 3 because 1 occurs 2 times in the array and 2 occurs 3 times.<br>

Write a function named stantonMeasure that returns the Stanton measure of its array argument.
