<b>QUESTION 1</b> <br>
It is a fact that there exist two numbers x and y such that x! + y! = 10!. Write a method
named solve10 that returns the values x and y in an array.
The notation n! is called n factorial and is equal to n * n-1 * n-2 * ... 2 * 1, e.g., 5! = 5*4*3*2*1
= 120.

<b><u>Note: </u></b> <br>
Please be sure that the method solve10 returns an array, a, with two elements
where a[0] == x, a[1] == y and x! + y! = 10!.
