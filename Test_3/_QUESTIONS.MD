<b>QUESTION 1</b> <br>
Define a square pair to be the tuple <x, y> where x and y are positive, non-zero integers, x<\y and x + y is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer whose square root is also an integer, e.g. 4, 9, 16 are perfect squares but 3, 10 and 17 are not. Write a function named countSquarePairs that takes an array and returns the number of square pairs that can be constructed from the elements in the array. For example, if the array is {11, 5, 4, 20} the function would return 3 because the only square pairs that can be constructed from
those numbers are <5, 11>, <5, 20> and <4, 5>. You may assume that there exists a function named isPerfectSquare that returns 1 if its argument is a perfect square and 0 otherwise. E.G., isPerfectSquare(4) returns 1 and isPerfectSquare(8) returns 0.
